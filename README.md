# Module-2-Challenge
## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze the success of a small number of green energy stocks in order to help better inform my friend Steve's clients as to what their best investment choice might be. The data is only from two years. The anaylsis only calculates performence for the year being analyzed, and does not compare performance between years, though we can compare the outputs of the years. Performance indicators include totalt daily volume throughout the year as well as the the return of the stock. The return of the stock is defined in this anaylsis as the percentage price increase or decrease of the stock at the end of the year as compared to what it was at the beginning.
## Results
